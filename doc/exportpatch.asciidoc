NAME
----
exportpatch - a tool to export patches from git with proper tags

SYNOPSIS
--------
*exportpatch* [options] <commit> [<commit> ...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *exportpatch* utility is a tool for exporting one or more patches
rom git repositories with the tags that are expected for import into
the SUSE kernel-source repository.

It is a requirement that each 'commit' is contained in the git remote repository
as well as the local repository, though this can be overridden using the '-f'
option.

The behavior of *exportpatch* is controlled by the options below and the
*patchtools.cfg(5)* configuration files. If no configuration files are
available, *exportpatch* defaults to using the current directory as a
git repository, the email address configured for use with git, and the
user's real name from the system password database.

All listed commits are exported as patch files, with processing halted if
an error is detected.

TAGS
----
The following are the patch header tags that *exportpatch* can add
to the exported patch file:

*Git-commit*::
All exported patches will contain a 'Git-commit' tag that
identifies the commit that contains the patch.
It uses the full 40-character SHA1 hash.
+
When using the '--extract' or '--exclude' options documented below, this tag will
also contain the text "(partial)" to identify it as incomplete.

*Git-repo*::
When the repository is not a clone of an upstream "mainline" repository, this
tag will contain the URL of the remote repository.

*Patch-mainline*::
If the repository is identified as a clone of the upstream "mainline" repository,
this tag will contain the text of the oldest tag to contain this commit.
+
By default, the list of upstream mainline repositories is as follows, but can
be extended using *patch.cfg(5)*.
+
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux-2.6.git
git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
+
If the commit originated in a repository that is not an upstream mainline clone,
it is assumed to have originated in a subsystem maintainer repository and
the tag will contain "Queued in subsystem maintainer repository" instead of a version tag.
A 'Git-repo' tag will also be automatically added.

*Acked-by*::
If the patch doesn't already contain an 'Acked-by' or 'Signed-off-by' tag
with the configured email address, an 'Acked-by' tag will be added to the
patch unless the '--signed-off-by' option is used.

*References*::
A 'References' tag can optionally be added. Only one tag will be exported.
It can contain multiple references.
The following are suggested values for the 'References' tag.

Bugzilla:::
A bugzilla identifier prefixed with 'bsc#' e.g. 'bsc#123450'.
Other bugzilla instances can be specified using a similar abbreviation.

JIRA:::
The content should be a JIRA feature request ID prefixed with 'jsc#',
e.g. 'jsc#PED-348'.

*Patch-filtered*::
When the '--extract' or '--exclude' options are used,
the patch will contain a 'Patch-filtered' tag indicating
what filters were used when exporting the commit.

OPTIONS
-------

*--version*::
Show program's version number and exit.

*-h*, *--help*::
Show help message and exit.

*-w*, *--write*::
Write the output to file(s) instead of 'stdout'. Default is to write to 'stdout'.
The filenames default to being a "safe" version of the commit's summary and
can be modified using some of the options below, which can add a numeric
prefix (see '-n'), and/or a suffix (see '-s'). The filename length is limited
to 64 characters, since subject lines can be arbitrarily long.
+
If writing to 'stdout', the patch file(s) are output in the order the commits were specified.
This output can be captured to provide a series file for consumption by *quilt(1)*.

*-s*, *--suffix*::
When used with '--write', append '.patch' suffix to filenames.

*-n*, *--numeric*::
When used with '--write', prepend order numbers to filenames. This will produce
filenames prefixed with '0001-', '0002-', etc.

*-N FIRST_NUMBER*, *--first-number=FIRST_NUMBER*::
When used with '--numeric', start the number at *FIRST_NUMBER* instead of 1.

*-d DIR*, *--dir=DIR*::
Instead of writing the patch(es) to the current directory, write them to
*DIR*.

*-f*, *--force*::
By default, *exportpatch* will not overwrite existing files or export a commit
that only exists in the local repository. The latter behavior is a protection
against adding patches to the kernel repository that look like they are
upstream at a glance but are not.

*-D*, *--debug*::
Enable more verbose debugging output.

*-F REFERENCE*, *--reference=REFERENCE*::
Add a 'References' tag to the patch output using the specified reference.
+
This option may be specified multiple times.

*-x EXTRACT*, *--extract=EXTRACT*::
Extract specific parts of the commit. *EXTRACT* is a pathname. If the path
ends with '/', it includes all files under that hierarchy.
+
This option may be specified multiple times.
+
Use of this option is documented in the patch output by appending "(partial)"
to the Git-commit tag and adding one or more Patch-filtered tags that contain the paths extracted.

*-X EXCLUDE*, *--exclude=EXCLUDE*::
Exclude specific parts of the commit. *EXCLUDE* is as pathname. If the path
ends with '/', it excludes all files under that hierarchy.
+
This option may be specified multiple times.
+
Use of this option is documented in the patch output by appending "(partial)"
to the 'Git-commit' tag and adding one or more 'Patch-filtered'
tags that contain the paths excluded.

*-S*, *--signed-off-by*::
By default, every patch exported has the user's 'Acked-by' tag added to it.
This option uses the 'Signed-off-by' tag instead of 'Acked-by'.

EXIT STATUS
-----------
*exportpatch* returns a zero exit status if it succeeds. Non-zero is returned
in case of failure.
