===========

NAME
----
fixpatch - a tool to fix already exported patches

SYNOPSIS
--------
*fixpatch* [options] <patch> [<patch> ...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *fixpatch* utility is a tool for fixing common issues with patches that
have already been exported from a git repository using `exportpatch(1)`,
`git-send-email(1)` or `gitweb(1)` raw commit text functionality.

The behavior of *fixpatch* is controlled by the options below and the
*patchtools.cfg(5)* configuration files. If no configuration files are
available, *fixpatch* defaults to using the current directory as a
git repository, the email address configured for use with *git*, and the
user's real name from the system password database.

Unless otherwise specified, default options are to:

* Add any missing 'Acked-by' tag.
* Add a diffstat of the patch between the commit text and the patch content.
* Rename the patch to a lower-case "safe" version of the patch subject,
with optional suffix (see '-s-' below).
* Detect and use a commit id detected in the patch content to generate a
proper 'Git-commit' tag.
** 'X-Git-Url' header added by `gitweb(1)`
** Unix-style mbox 'From' (no colon)
* Use the 'Git-commit' tag to resolve 'Patch-mainline' and 'Git-repo' tags, if any.

TAGS
----
Please see the *TAGS* section in the manual page for `exportpatch(1)` for
